# GSL1680
Arduino library for the GSL1680 touch panel controller

Currently just a test sketch, hard coded for the 800x640 5" panel.

The firmware file is big so it needed to be compressed to fit in an Uno flash memory.

Once tested and working I'll convert to a library, and have a #define for the two version of firmware
for the 5" panels from buydisplay.com.

This has been made into an arduino library here https://github.com/Skallwar/GSL1680

Use 1.8.5
