# GSL1680
Arduino library for the GSL1680 touch panel controller.

Currently works for Arduino MEGA and hardcoded for 800x640 5" capacitive touch panel from BuyDisplay.

The firmware file is big so it needed to be compressed to fit in an Uno flash memory (currently not tested)

Based on wolfmanjm/GSL1680 and discussions on: https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/26256-Has-anyone-tried-running-the-GSL16880-capacitive-touchscreen-controller-with-Teensy3
